# Getting Started

This is the best place to start to get up and running with the Plastic Anthony application as a developer. The application was originally made by Brother Kermode in the summer of 2015 as an Angular2.x application, and was then ported to a React and Redux application in the summer of 2016, and refined in 2017. Fair warning; if you don't know anything about React or Redux, you're going to have a _very_ difficult time working on this codebase.

### React and Redux Resources
Start by learning React *without* Redux, as trying to learn the two together can be overwhelming. The [official tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) is a great place to start, and here are some other useful guides:

 * [Hacking with React](http://www.hackingwithreact.com/)
 * [React Armory](https://reactarmory.com/guides/learn-nude-react)

Once you feel comfortable in React, you should be able to understand a lot of this codebase. Redux is a state management library that handles things like user information, routing, and other data processing logic. Again, the [official documentation](http://redux.js.org/) is the best place to start. You can then look to the wealth of other online resources:

 * [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/)
 * [Learn Redux (in a single file)](https://github.com/wesbos/Learn-Redux)

### React Boilerplate
Now that you know React and Redux, you should be ready to take a look at Plastic Anthony (PA). Note that PA uses several other abstractions, such as [Redux Sagas](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) and [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk). Don't worry about these technologies just now, but be aware that you may need to understand their basics to make meaningful modifications to the application.

PA was developed from the [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) starter, which provides a high-grade development environment for React applications. The boilerplate also provides [very useful documentation](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate/tree/master/docs) on the frameworks and abstractions it uses.
